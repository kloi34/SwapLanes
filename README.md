# SwapLanes
Switch selected notes' lanes around (in the Quaver map editor)

You can make a map with permanently and specifically randomized lanes with this plugin. To do so, go to an existing map, File > Create New Difficulty > Copy Current Map, and use this plugin on the copy of the map.

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP file by pressing the green download code button on GitHub and clicking "Download ZIP"
2. Extract the ZIP file to the "Plugins" folder (located inside the main Quaver folder)

(Side note: Can't upload this plugin to Quaver's Steam Workshop because I'm on a Mac -.-)
